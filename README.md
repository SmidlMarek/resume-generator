## Requirements

* [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)


## Getting Started

Before you continue, be sure that you have all the necessary [requirements](#requirements) for this project.

### Create Your Own "Fork" of this Project

"Forking" is like creating a copy of a project. While logged in to your GitHub account, ["fork" this repository](https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/resume-generator/fork). This will create a copy of the project, but in your account.

Once you've created your fork, you will need to download a copy of the git repository to your local machine. To do this you will "clone" the repository using the following command in the terminal window where you use git:
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/resume-generator.git
```
Be sure you replace **YOUR_USERNAME** with your GitHub username.


### Install Project Dependencies

Like any node.js-based project, you will need to run `npm install` to get all the necessary dependencies for running the project locally.

Once the install process has finished, move on to the next step.


### Generate Resume

This project comes with sample configuration [options](https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/resume-generator/blob/master/options.json) and [resume data](https://github.com/Learn-by-doing/resume-generator/blob/master/resume.json). To generate resume-generator files, run the following command:
```
node run-script generate
```
